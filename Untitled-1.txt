Assumptions:
When attacking all troops attack
the winner keeps all his troops while the loser loses them
the heuristics is the sum of the heuristics of each city of my User 

Logic class 
Non Ai agents 
Passive : finds the min of country.troops and add troops to them and doesnt attack
Aggresive : put the bonus troops in max of country.tropps and the attack on the max country.troops of the other user in all of the countries 
Semi-Passive : Put the bonus troops like the Passive but attacks in the min country.troops by searching in the adjacencies lists and fininding the neighbours to check whether we can attack or no 

Data structures:
Priority Queue: to know the heuristics and which state to go in.
Arrays : to kput all the states in it 
Set : to know whether i visited the state before or not

The 4 AI agents are :
1)Greedy agent: picks nove with best heuristic value. h(n) = number of enemytroops/numberofmytroops terroriterios
P=  1x20+305=325
    100x20+305=20350
    10000x20+305=2000350


2)A* agent: uses same heuristic ; difference is f(n) = g(n) + h(n) where g is the depth in tree
p=  1x17+250=267
    100x17+250=17250
    10000x17+250=1700250


3)Real Time A* agent: same as A* along with depth limiting feature and adjusting heuristics each time.
p=  1x14+250=264
    100x14+250=14250
    10000x14+250=1400250

4)Minimax agent: uses minimize and maximize functions along with pruning

Search technique is up to the user to choose. Whenever an non human agent is used troops are distributed by random.
